## Description

This challenge deals with taking starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactoring it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

The application itself is a google book search engine. It allows you to login, search for books and then save them to your library.
